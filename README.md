# PhD Information/Resources and Other Rants
Hi there!! So, here, I'll be adding helpful information for my PhD. I got this idea from a [senior colleague](https://github.com/33fred33) in my programme and would love to ride on it. So, let's go!!

- [Association for Machine Translation in the Americas](https://amtaweb.org)
  
AMTA is the North American component of the International Association for Machine Translation (IAMT), which also includes the Asian-Pacific Association for Machine Translation (AAMT) and the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT). The IAMT Council comprises a balanced representation of all  regions. Members of any of the three regional associations automatically become part of the IAMT network. AMTA is governed by the by-laws codified in this document.
